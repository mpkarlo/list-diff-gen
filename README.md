# List Diff Generator
Given two text files with a list of items each, compares the lists between each other and generates a small report of
the differences between them including total lines, total unique items, items in common, and items not in the opposite
list. Optionally, files can be generated containing the items missing from each opposite list (items in list A not in B,
and vice versa). If the text file given contains multiple columns, then the user is prompted to choose which columns to
use for each file.
